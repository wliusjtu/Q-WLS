# Quasi Weighted Least Squares

This is the released code for the following paper accepted to International Journal of Computer Vision:

*Fast Global Image Smoothing via Quasi Weighted Least Squares.* Wei Liu, Pingping Zhang, Hongxing Qin, Xiaolin Huang, Jie Yang, Michael Ng, International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2024

**Usage:**
1. run mexFile.m in the "funs" folder to compile all the C files first.
2. run the example functions for different tasks.
